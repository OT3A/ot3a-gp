# Safe Intelligent Transportation in Digital Cities (OT3A Graduation project)
# Case
- Transportation is a critical sector to any country as it acts as the  vessel for all other activities including individuals, enterprises, governmental, and commercial services. 
- Key drainers of transportation systems are accidents caused by unsafe driving patterns and critical incidents that affect safety. For example, a traffic accident on a highway could result in a chain of accidents. This phenomenon has happened quite frequently over the past years. 
- Irresponsible driving attitude resulted in severe accidents and sudden utility incidents such as pipeline bursts, which could cause even more damage if not contained in a timely fashion. 
- Mobilizing action forces teams to handle such incidents is also crucial in mitigating the associated risks. 
- Utilizing AI methods and techniques can function as computer vision, statistical analysis, and optimization to anticipate, spot, and act on such incidents prospectively suggesting the best ways to handle them. 
- The current direction is adopting intelligent transportation systems nationwide; such solutions can leverage collected data from cameras, sensors, and official information systems to provide capabilities to involve governmental and community sectors to act faster and more accurately. 
- Such enhanced performance in a key sector like transportation works as the cornerstone for digital cities by enabling better planning and implementation of related services. 
- Using Spatial AI as a part of the solution can overcome the difficulties associated with transportation networks operating on very large-scale geographies.
